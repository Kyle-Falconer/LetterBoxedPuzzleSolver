# Letter Boxed Puzzle Solver

The New York Times has a puzzle in their NYT Games called [Letter Boxed]. This project is a solution finder for that puzzle.

The solver assumes the puzzle can be solved in one or two words, and outputs all found solutions, though because the word list being used with this program is not the same as what NYT is using, some solutions found may not be considered valid words.
